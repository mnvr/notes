# Timing and taste

GitHub's cofounder on
[why GitHub won](https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-github-actually-won/). Timing
and taste resonating with each other.

> All four GitHub cofounders had flops before and after GitHub. These ventures
> had taste, but it wasn't the right time or market.
>
> The other players who started after seeing Git and GitHub's rise in popularity
> had no taste.

> ...the Ruby people, strange people, started using Git and suddenly it just
> exploded...
